**An Anishinaabemowin Vocabulary App**

## **Anishinaabemowin Language**  
Anishinaabemowin, also known as Ojibwe, is one of the largest Indigenous languages north of Mexico. It is the ancestral language of the Anishinaabe people and is spoken across parts of Canada and the United States, particularly around the Great Lakes region. As a living language carrying centuries of cultural knowledge and wisdom, it remains vital to Anishinaabe identity and way of life.

## **The Leitner Learning System**  
MOWIN utilizes the Leitner system, a scientifically proven method of spaced repetition learning, developed by Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s. This system helps learners study more efficiently by focusing on words they find most challenging.

### **How It Works:**  
- Flashcards are sorted into boxes based on how well you know them.  
- Correctly answered cards move to the next box and are reviewed less frequently.  
- Incorrect cards return to the first box for more frequent review.  

This method ensures learners spend more time on challenging words and less time on ones they already know, creating an effective and personalized learning experience.
