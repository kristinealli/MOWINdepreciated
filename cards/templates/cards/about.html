                            Anishinaabemowin, also known as Ojibwe, is one of the largest Indigenous languages north of Mexico. 
                            It is the ancestral language of the Anishinaabe people and is spoken across parts of Canada and the 
                            United States, particularly around the Great Lakes region. As a living language that carries centuries 
                            of cultural knowledge and wisdom, it continues to be vital to Anishinaabe identity and way of life.

                            MOWIN uses the Leitner system, a scientifically proven method of spaced repetition learning. 
                            This system was developed by Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s and is designed to help users 
                            learn more efficiently by focusing on the material they find most challenging.
